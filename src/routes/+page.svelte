	<h2>Some notes</h2>

	<p>
		The aspect of this website I had the most fun implementing was the page transitions. They might
		not be the flashiest, but given how janky they were at first, I'm happy with how clean they
		turned out (both visually and in the "clean code" sense).
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing I'm definitely <span class="italic">not</span> happy with as of now is the background.
		I originally had a (manually implemented) directed force graph kinda just floating there,
