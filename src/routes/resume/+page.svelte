	<h1>Resume</h1>

	<div class="divider" />

	<p>
		My resume is still in its very early stages, so if you have any suggestions and/or advice, I
		would appreciate it a lot if you <a href="/contact">contact</a>ed me! :)
	</p>

	<p>
		Since my resume is in constant flux currently, I'm embedding the Google Doc for now, which syncs
		every ~5 minutes but has layout differences (especially on smaller screen sizes).

<!-- When my resume is more stabilized, consider using `embed`: -->
<!-- <embed src="pdfUrl" type="application/pdf" width="1000" height="600" /> -->
