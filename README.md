My personal website! Very much _not_ intended as a template, but feel free to yoink certain parts.

Built using:

- [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [DaisyUI](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui)
- [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons)

Also hosts my resume, written in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). If you have any feedback, please let me know! 🙏

## Next steps
